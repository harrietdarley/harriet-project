# Personal Portfolio & CV 
This is my personal website and CV which I created in order for potential employers, collaborators and other coders to visit. The website lists my front end development skills and previous employment, work experience and education. There are also links to my social media pages such as GitHub, Facebook and Instagram where they can find more information.  

Users can complete my contact form to enquire about future collaborations or to hire me, or simply just to get in touch. 


## UX
My website provides a detailed and informative description of my personal skills and experience. I styled my website in a way that the information could be displayed clearly and creatively for the users. I chose fonts that are engaging and clear and a consistent yet bright colour scheme to attract visitors. I thought the abstract background to begin would catch the users attention as it is unusual and reflects a style I personally like. 

### User Stories 


### Wireframes
I created my wireframes using Abode XD, I displayed two different aspects; one from a laptop and one from a phone, to ensure my webpage would be responsive from a variety of technology.
